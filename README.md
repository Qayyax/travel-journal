# Travel Journal (with React)

This is a solo project that helped me learn about `props` in React and also how to use `.map` method in React to load dynamic components

[Deployed site](https://travel-react-me.netlify.app/)

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
